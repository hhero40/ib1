I'm Lorri now, and fuck! It feels so good to be Lorri! That fucker thought he could abuse me for years and never suffer any consequences. Ha! Give me some paper and I'll sign whatever you want...and while I'm at it I've got something else you might like to know...&quot;\n\nLorri details the times when she was abused by her husband and signs her name to it (her old name), then tells you something very interesting about her husband's investigaion techniques.

Do that and everything I just showed you stays with me.&quot;''\n\nHe nods, his neck straining with the effort, slams in brief case onto your desk and attepmts to make a call on his cell as he leaves.\n\n''&quot;You won't reach her.

O'Neil's shoulders sag, his head drops and he walks away. Defeated. You turn to Lorri.\n\n''&quot;A magnificent performance, Lorri. Have you had a chance to think about what you want to do now?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Yes, but I will need your help. I want to help women that have been through what I have. I want to care for them, help them recover...then bring them to you. Your Machine is better than any therapist.&quot;\n\n''&quot;What would you need from me?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Funding. I could get a program up an running easily with the right money behind it. $3000 a month for myself and my expences would cover it.&quot;\n\nIt's an interesting proposal. It's not a lot of money for a potential goldmine of goodwill, not to mention the extra customers. In the light of all that's happened this isn't the kind of thing you can turn down.\n\n''&quot;Ok, Lorri, I will fund you for 3 months. After that I will review your progress.&quot;''\n&lt;&lt;set $expenses = $expenses + 3000&gt;&gt;\n&quot;I knew you were a good guy.

She may be resistant to The Device and unwilling to tell you anything, but she is not skilled in interrogation techniques, already letting slip that her connection to Dr Mibb runs deeper than you knew. \n\nOnce Officer Lexis Fucks' treatment is finished you will be able to throw Daryl into The Machine to test how resistant she really is. For the hours that pass until then you continue to interogate Daryl. She doesn't give much up, but you do learn that whatever her connection was to Dr Mibb she has it no longer.

Then there's all the time I spend with my students, I just can't seem to prioritise myself over them.&quot;\n\nThat is enough to ease your suspicion of any ulterior motive she might have.\n\n''&quot;Completely understandable, I promise you will revieve nothing but the best of care from us.

The final member of the team was the man you know as Dr Oscar Mibb, not his real name, of course.&quot;\n\n[img[intro/Mibb1.jpg]]\n\n&quot;We are well educated in our fields, but none of us had the sheer brilliance of Mibb. He insisted that we begin our research on women, as you probably know men and women are biologically distinctive, and we had to begin somewhere. Are you following?&quot;\n\nYou nod.\n\n&quot;Good. It took years of failure before Mibb had a breakthrough, but we were oblivious to the true nature of it at the time. He would have had to wait months, possibly years, for approval to conduct human testing. He wasn't willing to wait that long, so my colleagues and I became his guinea pigs. One by one he forced us into that machine he'd created. When I came out my body had completely changed and I felt uncontrollably horny.&quot;\n\n[img[month11/orig2.jpg]] \n\n&quot;He had intended to make us his bimbo-slaves, but his design was flawed. After our initial libido subsided we were left with our free will intact. However, in this time Mibb was able to recognise our independence and chose to flee. What he did not take with him he destroyed, but our memories of what happened where intact, and our bodies were evidence enough to convince the board of Alliance Corp that Mibb had invented something special.&quot;\n\nShe pauses to look you up an down.\n\n&quot;Since then it has been the task of myself and my colleagues to hunt Mibb down, with all the resources Alliance Corp has to offer.&quot;\n\n''&quot;For what? You want your old bodies back?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Ha! Don't be silly. I fucking love my new body. Pause and think for a moment. Imagine what could be done with that tech in our hands. We are intelligent, independent women who believe in the opportunity this technology will give all women. And, more importantly, we stand against the world of women-slaves Mibb wants to create.&quot;\n\n''&quot;But why me, what do I have to do with all this?&quot;''\n\n&quot;I can't say for sure, but I would guess that Mibb wanted to use you to draw us out, beyond that his mind is too fucked up to predict.&quot;\n\n''&quot;And what now? You want me to give you my Machine?&quot;''\n\n&quot;We want much more than that. We want you to give us Mibb. We believe he has already been in contact with you recently and predict that he will seek you out again soon. You have proven yourself a capable man, deliver us Mibb and we will work together to make the good bimbo dream become a reality.&quot;\n\nStunned from this revelation you barely turn your head as the mysterious woman drops a contact card in your lap and leaves the room.\n\nOutside everyone is too busy celebrating to have noticed the super-secret bimbo-agent slip past them.

As a result our ratings dropped considerably. This led to his departure from the station and my replacing him. My task is to alter our programming to bring back viewers. My task has gone reasonably well besides three holdouts who are still loyal to Swinson's principles, all of whom have contracts too expensive to terminate. I want you to use whatever method you have used in the city's transformation to convince these three to join the 'bimbo' side.&quot;\n\n''&quot;What you ask is within my capabilities. Who are the holdouts?&quot;''\n\n&quot;They are all women from our news division. There is Carmen Stockbridge, the sports field reporter; Kathleen Darby, our lead producer on the local community; and Stacy Aiken, consultant for politics. In each case you must get the employee in question to fall in line, pay for their contract termination, $100,000 each, from your own pocket or find an alternate solution.

Officer Brandy arrives quickly, and she has a plan.\n\n[img[month9/porn30.jpg]]\n\n&quot;I've totally wanted to do something like this for years! It'll be like, soooo easy. First, you bring some of your //patients// here. Second, I give them high quantities of illegal substances form the evidence lock up. Third, they plant the evidence. Forth, have someone with no connection to you come to the police with a //tip//. And finally I arrest that son of a bitch. Sound good?&quot;\n\n''&quot;Yes it does. you get the substances and I'll get the girls.&quot;''\n\nYou make a call to Mr Rocks, who is anaware that you know about his betrayal, and as him to send Ami and Lela, the two pornstars that had the experimental ass and tit treatments, here for a checkup. Of course he agrees. Ami is the first to arrive.\n\n[img[month9/porn28.jpg]]\n\n''&quot;Hi Ami, there's some thing I need you to do for me. But, first, how about a booster treatment?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Omigod yes please!&quot;\n\nShe rushes into The Machine.\n\n[img[intro/machine2.jpg]]\n\nYou input a program sepcially designed by Debz and activate The Machine. The program wont alter Ami much physically, but it should make her obedient to you above all others. When her treatment finishes you just have one question to ask.\n\n''&quot;Who do you belong to?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Like, so totally you!&quot;\n\nExcellent, there's just one more thing to do to seal the deal...\n\n[img[month9/porngif10.gif]]\n\nWith that done Brandy give Ami the evidence to plant and she leaves to carry out your wish. Soon after Lela arrives.\n\n[img[month9/porn29.jpg]]\n\nShe recieves exectly the same treatment...and she recieves it just as well.\n\n[img[month9/porngif11.gif]]\n\nNow with 2 moles to plant Brandy's evidence you simply have to wait for Brandy to carry out the rest of the plan.\n\n-------------------\n\nA few days later Mr Rocks' arrest is all over the news, Brandy's plan was 100% successful. There's just one loose end to tie up. Brandy brings the girl she used to convey her //tip// to the police into the salon.\n\n[img[month9/porn25.jpg]]\n\n&quot;This is Sara, she's been a bad girl. I've arrested Sara several times on various charges and once she got a job as a newbie pornstar the first thing she does is lie to the police about her boss.&quot;\n\nAt this Sara pipes up. &quot;Hey! You made me do that! You bitch!&quot;\n\n&quot;And you did very well, only you're unreliable. Although that can be fixed, which is why you're hear.&quot;\n\nBrandy practically manhandles Sara into The Machine.\n\n[img[intro/machine2.jpg]]\n\n&quot;Turn it up to max, you don't want that bitch saying the wrong thing to the wrong person.&quot;\n\nYou take Brandy's advice. 5 hours pass before Sara's treatment finishes and she steps out.\n\n[img[month9/porn27.jpg]]\n\n''&quot;Sara, how are you feeling?&quot;''\n\n&quot;I like to suck cock!&quot;\n\n''&quot;If you are asked about the events of the past few days what will you say?&quot;''\n\n&quot;Will you fuck my pussy?&quot;\n\nSara is clearly not going to give you away. It took 5 days to bring the plan to completion, but it will have destroyed any credibility  to Mr Rocks' evidence against you. His business is still there, but even if he does get off with this by that time it won't be his business any more. Although the details will have to wait, for just now you still have to deal with as much of the incriminating evidence agianst you as you can.\n&lt;&lt;set $incrimination = $incrimination - 8&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $days = $days - 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $ppwife eq &quot;fucked&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $m9pornend = 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $m9pornend = 4&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $sms = &quot;porn&quot;&gt;&gt;\n[[The rest of the evidence|m9evidence]]\n</div><div tiddler="m10newbim2" tags="" created="201705231633" modifier="twee" twine-position="1955,13061">''&quot;I believe there is an agreement we can reach.

The treatment you had Debz design will last for 24 hours. It runs on a setting so low that she had to program it into The Machine herself. Jordyn Star is far to valuable an asset to risk damaging anything about her. There's only one thing about her that isn't practically perfect, her loyalty to you, and over the next 24 hours that will change. If Debz has come through for you with her programing Jordyn will be completely devoted to you once her treatment ends, and she'll probably show somw bimbo tendancies, they all do. Of course her body will alter, that's an unavoidable fact of The Machine. So you wait.\n\n-----------------\n\n24 hours later, when Jordyn's treatment is finally over, you open the door to find her completely passed out inside The Machine. Nobody else has been inside The Machine for anywhere close the that amount of time before. You have Summer take her to the spa to rest and recover, leaving instructions that you should be contacted the moment Jordyn is awake.\n\n-------------------\n\nYou're very curious to see what effect the experimental treatment had on Jordyn.
